### What's this
This is a collection of csv files of HSK words. Words are assigned to different files,
based on their level.

##### Example entries:
```
现代,xiàn dài,modern times
羡慕,xiàn mù,to envy
限制,xiàn zhì,to restrict
香,xiāng,fragrant
相反,xiāng fǎn,opposite
详细,xiáng xì,detailed
```

The format is: `chinese,pinyin,english`
Only one english translation is provided.
The files are automatically generated, as such, not all the translations are correct and some of them are quite long.

### Source
The files were automatically generated from [gigacool/hanyu-shuiping-kaoshi](https://github.com/gigacool/hanyu-shuiping-kaoshi)
